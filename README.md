This is a data infrastructure for ASP.NET MVC project that doesn't use Entity Framework and has it's own simple ORM. This is written to be used with Oracle because that is what I am using but should be easily converted for other databases.

### Why? ###

Besides being too slow, using Entity Framework was difficult to work with data that I use at my current position.

The data is not normalized but has been processed for reporting. I also use a lot of written queries to retrieve data in order to create charts, graphs, and other reports. A lot of custom object building and business logic is needed that was too time consuming to due using entity framework.

This infrastructure was much faster and allowed me to focus on getting the data and processing it quickly.

This was written on my own time.
